Make sure you have Tor installed and running on your system before running this script. You can start Tor by running tor in your terminal. This script assumes Tor is running on the default port 9050.

Replace the URL of the Tor hidden service you want to query.

Save the script to a file (e.g., query_tor_page.sh), make it executable (chmod +x query_tor_page.sh), and then run it (./query_tor_page.sh).
